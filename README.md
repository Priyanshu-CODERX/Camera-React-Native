# Camera App React Native
#### With this project I learned to access camera and click pictures, change front & back camera and activate flash light while clicking picture

# How I developed this?
#### I followed ![**expo-camera**](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/) to access camera in mobile devices and use them to click pictures.
